        <p>Hi, my name is not important
I'm not from here, I'm imported
I drink liquor like it's water
Hope my liver can afford it
I've been lyin' here with...
I've been lyin' here, I'll be lyin' here
I'm under the covers like
What happened here ain't nothing sacred
Shit that got me fucked up is
I know that dude just saw me naked
Nursing a broken heart
But who'd've thought it'd take me ages?
I ended up here 'cause my girl said, "Fake it 'til you make it"</p>
